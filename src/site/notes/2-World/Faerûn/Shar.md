Shar, also known as Mistress of the Night and the Lady of Loss, was the goddess of darkness and the night in the Faerûnian pantheon and the malevolent twin sister and counterpart to the goddess of the moon, [[3-Mechanics/CLI/deities/forgotten-realms-selune\|Selûne]]. In the 14th and 15th centuries DR, she held the portfolios of darkness, forgetfulness, loss, and night and after she slew the underground god Ibrandul she claimed the portfolios of caverns, dungeons, and the Underdark. In the time of ancient Netheril, Shar also held the portfolios of hatred, sleep, nightmares, illusions, lies, trickery, hiding places, betrayal, treachery, seduction, thieves, thievery, murder, winter, before she lost these to other deities.

Shar was in constant conflict with Selûne, her sister and the goddess of the moon. Their war was the eternal drama of the sky, vital to the balance of nature: the dark of the night devouring the light of the moon, before the moon was renewed and the cycle repeated. In their never-ending struggle across the sky, Selûne was slain by Shar at every new moon. They fought incessantly to undercut the other. Shar spent most of her energy and attention on this eternal conflict, but rather than assault Selûne directly, she preferred to target what her sister loved, such as her faithful.
