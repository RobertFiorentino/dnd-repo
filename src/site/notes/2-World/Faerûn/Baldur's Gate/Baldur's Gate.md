## Overview
Baldur's Gate, the Halfway to Everywhere, the City of Blood, also simply called the Gate, is one of the largest metropolises and city-states on the Sword Coast, within the greater Western Heartlands. It is a crowded city of commerce and opportunity, and one of the most prosperous and influential merchant cities on the western coast of Faer√ªn. Despite its long-standing presence as a neutral power, the leaders of Baldur's Gate were members of the Lords' Alliance of powers in the west.

The strong peace-keeping force known as the Watch, along with the presence of the powerful [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company, kept the city generally peaceful and safe. This inherent sense of security allowed the Gate to keep a tolerant and welcoming attitude towards outsiders, whether they were wealthy merchants, poor refugees or, as it historically attracted, less-scrupulous individuals such as pirates and smugglers.
