Talona, one of the Dark Gods, is the goddess of poison and disease.  
  
She has the personality of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age. She alternately desires attention at any cost like a small child and becomes aloof like a wounded paramour who has been discarded by her love.

She is worshipped by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Plague Rats\|Plague Rats]]. 
[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Warwick Mahningham\|Warwick Mahningham]] is a priest of her temple.
