A circus originally run by halflings and other humanoids, the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Plague Rats\|Plague Rats]] cult took it over seemingly to have a cover to travel and spread the plague.

The original carnies were either killed and disposed of in the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Sewers\|Waterdeep Sewers]] or held hostage so as to not have a circus run entirely by golbins and ogres.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] followed the circus by boat and found them south of [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]]. The party set off a cart of fireworks as a distraction to successfully free the prisoners. After the hostages were brought to safety, the group decided they couldn't let the perpetrators live to spread the plague and harm others and returned to eradicate them.
