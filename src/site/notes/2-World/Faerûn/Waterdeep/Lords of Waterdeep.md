The Lords of Waterdeep were the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of Waterdeep, having governed the city from the 11th century onwards. They oversaw the regional economy, maintained security, performed diplomacy, and held legal jurisdiction over the city and exert their will over the surrounding lands for approximately 100 mi (160 km) beyond its walls.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]] suspected that Titus had joined the Lords of Waterdeep some time before the events of the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]].

Toward the end of the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]], the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]] disbanded the Lords of Waterdeep under the pretense of the noble class having died out from the plague. The council appointed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus Belabranta]] as the first King of Waterdeep to rule in their stead, claiming he came up with the cure.
