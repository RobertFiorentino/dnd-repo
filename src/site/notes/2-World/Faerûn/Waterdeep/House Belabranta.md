Belabranta is among the oldest noble houses of [[2-World/Faer√ªn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]], being officially ennobled in 952 DR. They are famous [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon-xmm\|Griffon]] breeders, trainers and even hunters.

The family owns a villa in the Sea Ward, on the northeast corner of Mendever Street and Rough Road.

Before House Belabranta became an official noble house of Waterdeep it could claim one of its members as a hero of the city. Ilithrew Belabranta was a famous griffon rider and hero of the second Trollwar. During that time he amassed a small fortune by plundering slain troll hoards. With some of those funds he was able to commission the construction of the Griffontack of Belabranta, a set of magical items passed down to future generations.
