In 1551 DR, the city of [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] was beset by a terrible plague. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] were tasked by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]] to uncover the source of plague.

A [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]] was found in a [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Boarded up inn\|Boarded up inn]] as well as the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Sewers\|Waterdeep Sewers]] that seems connected to the spread of the plague. [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Plague mushrooms\|Mushrooms]] were also found in the sewers that appear to be used in making the goo.

An unknown group we call the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Gray Cloaks\|Gray Cloaks]] seem to be involved in the cleanup of the plague, or in keeping the peace. This group is worth investigating.

Our investigation has brought you the source of the plague. The location of where it has been created. The ingredients used. The lair of the foul cult. We uncovered their plot to spread the plague under the guise of a circus, freed all the hostages, and destroyed that operation. According to instructions we intercepted, they had aims to continue spreading the plague down to Amn. We have prevented half the Sword Coast from being infected. Stopping that circus likely saved 10s if not 100s of thousands of lives.

We started out just investigating, but since then we have been kidnapped, imprisoned, have fought goblins, ogres, wererats, undead, displacer beasts, sea hags, giant octopi, and abominations. We have come close to death on many occasions. Two of my friends were bitten by wererats, and only through the grace of the gods were they able to avoid having a horrible curse bestowed on them that would forever alter their lives.

I ask you, do these risks and the services we provide not seem worth more than 25 gold a month, less than a blacksmiths wages? This armor alone costs 750 gold and I've needed it to stay alive on this quest. When we first came to you, you didn't know us but now you know exactly what we can do. We are immune to the plague and are your best chance at defeating it entirely. I ask for a substantial increase in compensation, access to equipment, contacts in this city and others, and a proper legal decree to give us official status and powers to investigate and deliver justice.
