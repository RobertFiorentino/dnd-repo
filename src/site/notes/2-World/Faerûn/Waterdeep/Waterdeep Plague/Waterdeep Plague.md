In 1551 DR, the city of [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] was beset by a terrible plague. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] were tasked by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]] to uncover the source of plague.

A [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]] was found in a [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Boarded up inn\|Boarded up inn]] as well as the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Sewers\|Waterdeep Sewers]] that seems connected to the spread of the plague. [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Plague mushrooms\|Mushrooms]] were also found in the sewers that appear to be used in making the goo.

An unknown group we call the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Gray Cloaks\|Gray Cloaks]] seem to be involved in the cleanup of the plague, or in keeping the peace. This group is worth investigating.
