The observatory is built on a series of basalt spires jutting up from the ocean at the southeastern tip of Stormwreck Isle. Almost all the structure's former ceilings and walls have crumbled away, exposing the ruins to the open air.

This is the site where [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] fought and killed a chromatic dragon over 100 years ago. It was this battle that made her swear to peace and found [[2-World/Faer√ªn/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]].

The blue wyrmling Sparkrender intended to use the magic built up here in a ritual to transform himself into something very powerful and destructive.
