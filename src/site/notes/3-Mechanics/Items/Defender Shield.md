As an action, the Defender Shield can be thrown at any target within Range . Up to two more targets can also be targeted, each must be within 15 feet of the last, after which it returns to the thrower.

The thrower makes a separate attack roll against each target doing 1d8 Bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Charisma modifier is used as a bonus to attack and damage on each roll.

The bonus to Armor Class does not apply to the player if using the throw action until the start of their next turn.

Once using the throw feature, roll a d4 at the start of every turn. On the roll of a 4, the shield has recharged and can be thrown again.
