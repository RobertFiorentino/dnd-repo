*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 155*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th Warlock

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra `1d8` Force damage to the target, plus another `1d8` per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the [Prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition if it is Huge or smaller.
