**Prerequisite**: [Dwarf](3-Mechanics/CLI/races/dwarf-xphb.md) or a Small race

You are uncommonly nimble for your race. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.  
- You gain proficiency in the [Acrobatics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics) skill (your choice).  
- You have advantage on any Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check you make to escape from being [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled).
