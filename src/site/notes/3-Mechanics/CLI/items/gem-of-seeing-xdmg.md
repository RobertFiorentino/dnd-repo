# Gem of Seeing
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/gem-of-seeing.webp#right)


This gem has 3 charges. As a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have [Truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
