# Counterspell
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), or [Reaction](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard (Abjurer)](list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-abjurer-xphb); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb); [Paladin (Oath of Redemption)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-redemption-xge); [Paladin (Oath of the Watchers)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-the-watchers-tce)
