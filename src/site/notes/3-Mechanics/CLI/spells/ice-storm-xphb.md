# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a mitten
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` Bludgeoning damage and `4d6` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the Cylinder into [Difficult Terrain](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb); [Artificer (Artillerist)](list-spells-classes-artificer-artillerist-tce); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-land-xphb); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb); [Wizard (Evoker)](list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb); [Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-the-ancients-xphb)
