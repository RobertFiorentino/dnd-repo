# Flaming Fist
## Overview
The Flaming Fist, or Flaming Fists, was a mercenary company based in the city of [[2-World/Faer√ªn/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]] on the Sword Coast, where its members served as city guards. They were one of the most powerful and expensive fighting forces in all the Realms during the 14th century DR, motivated primarily by the promise of riches and the glory of victory, though they edged on the side of promoting order throughout the Realms.
