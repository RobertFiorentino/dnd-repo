# Gray Cloaks
## Overview
We don't know much about this group of people who are seen involved with the disposing of bodies affected by the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]], but we believe we have seen then before in our adventures.

We realized at the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] coronation, the gray-green robes were those of the goddess [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]], worn by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Warwick Mahningham\|Warwick Mahningham]].
