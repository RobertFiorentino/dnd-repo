# Plague Rats
## Overview
The Plague Rats operated a temple in the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Rat Hills\|Rat Hills]], called the Rat's Maw. The Maw was an underground complex, part of the guild's headquarters, and was a complex, entertaining system of tunnels, rooms, and warrens. The regular sacrifices by the Rats were humanoids and other creatures infected with a wide array of plagues and afflictions while keeping them alive and suffering on the temple's shrine.

It was revealed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/MurkTail\|MurkTail]] that the Plague Rats worship the goddess of disease [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]].
