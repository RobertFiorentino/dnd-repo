•	The inn is a two-story stone building, appearing modest from the outside but offering a spacious and welcoming interior.
•	Its taproom features ample seating and a grand hearth, creating a relaxing environment for patrons.
•	A secret passageway within the inn’s cellar leads into the Watcher’s Forest.
