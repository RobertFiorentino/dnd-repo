#### Appearance
An elderly human woman with weathered brown skin , white hair in tight braids, and kindly hazel eyes, dressed in a simple white robe.

#### Voice
Gentle, soft, somewhat slow and peaceful

#### Description
Elder Runara is the leader of [[2-World/FaerÃ»n/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]]. She appears as a human woman, but she is actually an adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She guides the residents of the cloister in their contemplation and study. The cloister's inhabitants know Runara's true identity, but they do not speak of it to visitors.

She battled and slayed a chromatic dragon centuries ago at the [[2-World/Clifftop Observatory\|Clifftop Observatory]], and has been trying to heal the rift between dragons ever since.
