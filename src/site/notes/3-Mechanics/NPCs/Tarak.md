#### Appearance
Pale skin tanned darker with many freckles, auburn hair and a beard that is mostly gray, and gray-blue eyes.
Faded tattoos in an abstract design peek up the side of his neck from beneath his dirt stained robes.

#### Voice
Confident and kind

#### Description
Before coming to Dragon's Rest, Tarak was a criminal, but he has since devoted himself to the study of herbs and medicine. He is usually unarmed, but he keeps several daggers hidden in his cell.

An avid botanist, Tarak tends the cloister's garden plots, growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. He is soft spoken and helpful, eager to share his knowledge of herbalism. But his kindly demeanor belies his past as a ruthless poisoner for a thieves' guild. After his work led to the death of his lover, he fled the guild and plans to spend the rest of his life atoning for his past evils.

A gold hangman's noose is worked into the design of Tarak's visible tattoos, the mark as a symbol associated with the Gilded Gallows, a thieves' guild that operates in a country far to the southeast called Elturgard.
