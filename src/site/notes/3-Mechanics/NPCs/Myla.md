#### Description
Myla (lawful good kobold tinkerer) is a winged kobold whose brothers, Mek and Minn, now follow Sparkrender, the blue wyrmling in Clifftop Observatory. When Myla's wings were badly injured in an attack by stirges (which she describes as "hungry, icky, blood-sucking, batthings"), [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] helped in her recovery. Now Myla spends her time experimenting with alchemy, engineering, and magic.
