#### Description
Laylee is [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Myla\|Myla]]'s assistant. She aspires to become a Tinkerer, but has an adventurous and experimental streak which gets her into trouble.

Laylee accompanied [[1-Party/The Dream Team/The Dream Team\|The Dream Team]] to the Seagrow Caves, participating in combat using unusual tactics such as bottles of acid and a scorpion on a stick. She was poisoned during a fight and brought back from the brink of death by [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius Starblade]], leading her to adore him and naming him "Kobold-Friend". In exchange, she gave him magnet metal which Myla used to create the Defender Shield.
