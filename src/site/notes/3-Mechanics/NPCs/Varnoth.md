#### Appearance
Once tightly muscled, has thinned with age
Black hair is cropped close to her scalp, and her light brown skin bears many scars-one of which runs across her left eye, which is milky and blind
An elegant prosthetic made from wood and metal replaces her right leg below the knee.

#### Voice
Raspy, blunt

#### Description
Varnoth was a feared general at the head of a mercenary company called the Azure Wolves. Age and battle have taken a toll on her, and she is spending her twilight years in reflective contemplation at Dragon's Rest.

Her demeanor is gruff, but she is observant and empathetic. Above all, Varnoth believes in second chances and redemption.
