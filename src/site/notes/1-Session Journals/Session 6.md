# Chip and Dale. And a Hag
After the battle against the Frankenstein beast, the group headed back to the sewers to escape as quickly as possible. There they met an old woman who claimed to help people find their way through the sewers. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] agreed to a hefty price and let her lead the way.

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]] and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] argued over the halfling's talent when he revealed that his gifted lute playing was the result of using the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand-xphb\|Mage Hand]] spell. As they emerged onto the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Rat Hills\|Rat Hills]] near the old woman's shack, she was very insistent that the group use her nearby boat to get back to [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]. Suspicious of her demeanor for the whole trip, the group declined.

![ChipDaleHag.png|left|500](/img/user/z_Assets/ChipDaleHag.png)Enraged, the old woman revealed herself to be a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sea-hag-xmm\|Sea Hag]], with two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus-xmm\|Giant Octopus]] lovers named Chip and Dale summoned to eat the group. Most engaged the enemies from a distance, however the Sea Hag's death stare affected some of the group. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] tried setting her shack's roof on fire to distract her or get her attention.

The party focused their fire on the hag herself, hoping it would be enough to make Chip and Dale lose interest. This tactic turned out to work. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] was the first in the shack, and picked up [[3-Mechanics/Items/Spyglass of the Planes\|an item]] the others did not see. The party split up loot they found, most with the intentions of selling the gems and baubles, but [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] seemed entranced by the hag's locket and slipped it on.

After returning to [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] by boat which they paid to have docked, the group found that [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Thurgor\|Thurgor]] has passed away from the plague, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Alabaster\|Alabaster]] seemed to be in charge of the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]], although he appeared sick himself. The council informed the party that the circus associated with the beasts they have been fighting had been moving south towards Baldur's Gate.
