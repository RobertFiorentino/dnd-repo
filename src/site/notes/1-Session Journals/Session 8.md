# Big Top Melee
[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] discussed their next steps with the circus hostages. They decided to head back to [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]] to try to find refuge for their new friends. Strangely, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] unknowingly began speaking in a strange language no one could understand, before absent-mindedly clutching the hag's necklace around his neck.

Upon returning to [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]], the group informed the ranking officer about the recovered circus prisoners. He did not seem overly concerned to help, being more preoccupied with [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|plague]] at hand. The group did some shopping, with [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] borrowing from [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma\|Jelma]] to buy a fresh set of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/half-plate-armor-xphb\|Half Plate Armor]]. To be able to afford the armor, he had to trade in his [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/scale-mail-xphb\|Scale Mail]] as well as his [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword-xphb\|Longsword]], which puzzled to group as to how Cinder planned to fight without a weapon (and what would he argue with now?).

When facing the ranking officer again, he informed the group that he received a missive from the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]] in Waterdeep that the party is to return to Waterdeep immediately. He was very cagey with information, seeming to know more than he let on but he would answer no further questions.

![PactGlaive.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/PactGlaive.png)Without the luxury of time, and the Baldur's Gate security unwilling to help, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] decided that the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Plague Rats\|Plague Rats]] at the circus were too dangerous to let live due to their spreading of the plague and kidnapping. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]] agreed to stay with the circus refugees and try to find out more information about the situation in Waterdeep, while also offering [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] a position in his new circus which was humbly declined.

Sneaking around the perimeter of the circus, mayhem still ruled the circus as fires needed to be put out. Viewing the caged animals as the biggest threats, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] meddled with the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm\|Owlbear]] lock to jam it shut. This however alerted the owlbear and the goblin tamer. The goblin immediately ran to a lion's cage and freed it. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] attempted to tame the lion, and at least got it to leave in disinterest.

While the goblin was quickly dispatched by the group, the fight was readied for the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wererat-xmm\|Wererat]] leader and his rat ogre companion, as well as a slew of cultists. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] opened his hands and a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/pact-of-the-blade-xphb\|shadow glaive]] materialized. He chanted infernal utterances and darkness streamed from the hag's locket, enveloping him and his foes in complete [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness-xphb\|darkness]] .

![LionCircus.png|left |600](/img/user/z_Assets/LionCircus.png)Meanwhile, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] took a shining to the lion and cast a spell to [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce-xphb\|grow it]] to a massive size. Unfortunately, the spell didn't seem to give the wizard any actual control over the beast, who meandered about but at least didn't attack the team.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] hid in a nearby wagon and surprised an approaching cultist, obliterating his head with a shot from his bow. He was not able to flee in time from the massive rat ogre, who pounded the wood elf mercilessly. With the battle turning against him, the wererat ringleader ran into the circus tent for reinforcements.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] threw a bomb from under the flap, killing one of the cultists, while [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] attacked from the entrance. The wererat released the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-xmm\|Displacer Beast]], which Cinder engaged. The magical darkness seemed to cancel out the beast's displacement ability. The rest of the group circled the outside of the tent to cut off their enemy's escape. Cinder disengaged to confront the two approaching [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm\|Ogres]] from the circus entrance.
