# Ritual at the Clifftop Observatory

 Elder [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] asked [[1-Party/The Dream Team/The Dream Team\|The Dream Team]] to go up to the Temple of Bahamut so they could speak about everything happening. When they arrived, Runara was back in her human form, praying. Now that she trusted them, she felt comfortable telling the group the full story of what's been going on at Stormwreck Isle.

She detailed the violent history of the island, with frequent clashes between metallic and chromatic dragons. The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.

![ClifftopObservatoryPicture.png|left|500](/img/user/z_Assets/ClifftopObservatoryPicture.png)Each adventure the party had took place at the site of a dragon death, and this adventure would be no different. Up to now, Runara had been evasive about the location of [[2-World/Clifftop Observatory\|Clifftop Observatory]], but in reality she knew it was too dangerous for the adventurers until they gained experience and proved their abilities. She told them of a bronze wyrmling named Aidron came to the island a few months ago and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed away from the cloister.

![MoonstoneKey.png|right|300](/img/user/z_Assets/MoonstoneKey.png)Runara fears he went to the ancient observatory on the southeast side of the island, which is another dragon's final resting place. She suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen old wounds. She gives them the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Moonstone Key\|Moonstone Key]], a 3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on one end-and explains that they'll need it to access the observatory.

![Graska and Harlan.webp|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Graska%20and%20Harlan.webp)As the group approached the Observatory, they spotted the thugs [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Graska and Harlan\|Graska and Harlan]] hiding in the bushes. They came out and again demanded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tarak\|Tarak]]'s treasure. The party successfully convinced them that there was no treasure, but the thieves wanted compensation for their time and effort. They demanded 150 gold, but the party talked them down to 100 which they split and the thugs went on their way.

[[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius]] used the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Moonstone Key\|Moonstone Key]] to create a shimmering magical bridge that connects to the observatory tower.  However, removing the stone made the bridge disappear so they had to leave it behind. As they entered the central tower rotunda, they were surprised to see two kobolds fighting to the death with a nest of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/stirge-xmm\|Stirges]]. They recognized these kobolds as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Myla\|Myla]]'s brothers, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Mek and Minn\|Mek and Minn]]. Unsure if whether they should help or fight the kobolds, the stirges made the decision for them and started attacking the party!

This nest must have been particularly fired up, because one pierced Minn and drained all his blood in one shot. Minn hit the ground, dying. Mek tried to make his way to his brother while desparately trying to keep another stirge at bay. Meanwhile, another stirge latched onto [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]], driving his stinger deep into the dwarf's neck and starting to drain his blood.

Through magic and teamwork, the party quickly took out the stirges and approached the kobolds. Mek begged for help as Minn was on his last breath, and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius]] generously gave most of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-xphb#Lay on Hands (Level 1)\|lay on hands]] to revive the downed kobold. They said they heard legends of Aevarius "Kobold-Friend" and they found it to be true. The brothers were shocked to find out that Myla was still alive, and felt guilty for leaving her. They told the group about [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sparkrender\|Sparkrender]], and how he was conducting a ritual using dragon statues the kobolds created and painted. The ritual involved a "safrikice", that the party suspected as the dragon [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Aidron\|Aidron]] who now seemed in more danger.

![KoboldParty.png|left|500](/img/user/z_Assets/KoboldParty.png) Mek and Minn took the party to the northwest tower and introduced them to the other kobolds. They were having a "dragon party", where they wore various household and kitchen items to try to look like dragons. They invited the group to join their Dragon Club. With their newfound friends, they asked one of the winged kobolds to retrieve the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Moonstone Key\|Moonstone Key]] and bring it back to them, since doing so makes the magic bridge disappear. They used this to create a bridge to the southwest tower, where they found a magically trapped journal that required tracing a rune to open it. There they found a potion of lightning resistance and a cryptic passage:

<div align="center">"To ye four scholars: point your eyes toward the Dragon's light,
<br>for it guides your descent into knowledge."</div>

That left only the northeast higher tower left to explore. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] was hell-bent on discovering the secret knowledge the tower had to offer and couldn't care less about the dragon situation. As he took a pulley lift up to the tower, he realized that the dragon situation could not be ignored. There sleeping on a pile of treasure was Sparkrender himself, sleeping soundly.

![SparkrenderSleeping.png|right|500](/img/user/z_Assets/SparkrenderSleeping.png)Isarin also spotted four statues of what appeared to be scholars. This reminded him of the clue from the journal earlier, and he also spotted glowing constellations on the floor of various magical beasts. One was a constellation of a dragon, and he realized that not only was each statue pointing in a different direction, they appeared to be able to be spun to point in a different direction.

With the spark of a plan and more courage than usual, Isarin went back to ask to borrow Loreanna's [[3-Mechanics/Items/Boots of Elvenkind\|Boots of Elvenkind]] for their sneaking capabilities. Kanjigar and Aevarius decided to just hang out at the kobold dragon party. Isarin was new to sneaking, and almost woke the sleeping dragon but was inspired to be quiet as a mouse, allowing him to move around the tower unnoticed. Using the clue from earlier, he turned all four statues to point toward the dragon constellation in the southeast corner. 

![AidronPortrait.png|left|300](/img/user/z_Assets/AidronPortrait.png) Immediately the middle of the tower opened and stairs led down. Isarin quickly scampered down the stairs to the lower level of the tower and saw what appeared to be a trashed study with one wall caved in with rubble. Also in the room was [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Aidron\|Aidron]], the bronze dragon wyrmling who Sparkrender intended to sacrifice in the ritual. The young dragon was delighted to be set free, and implored the elf to help him defeat Sparkrender once and for all.

Isarin however was still more interested in finding the hidden knowledge that originally enticed him to come to this island. After some searching, he came across [[3-Mechanics/Items/Amulet of the Arcane Twins\|Amulet of the Arcane Twins]], a powerful artifact that greatly increases one's spellcasting capabilities. Satisfied with his discovery, Isarin didn't feel the need to confront the blue dragon at all and just waited around. Unfortunately, the situation would come to a head whether he wanted it or not...

![00-001-opening-splash.webp|right|500](/img/user/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/00-001-opening-splash.webp)Loreanna was tired of waiting around while the boys were off goofing around. Rather than formulating a plan, or working together, she got bored and just launched at arrow at the Sparkrender's neck. The beast awoke and roared in pain, but even worse was his fury that such an inferior creature would dare attack him. The wyrmling chased Loreanna back into the rotunda, where the commotion alerted Kanjigar and Aevarius as well, who both joined the fray. Aidron heard the sounds of battle with some backup, and eagerly flew up the stairs to join the fight with Isarin at his heels.

In their haste, Aevarius and Kanjigar forgot about a book they saw in the Dragon's Rest library that illustrated how NOT to stand in front of a blue dragon. They were perfectly lined up for Sparkrender's lightning attack, which shook them up dealing massive damage. Aevarius started to despair, never having felt such pain. Aidron had a breath weapon of his own however, and shot a repelling blast that knocked Sparkrender to the far wall, dazing him.

As the rest of the party laid on attacks, Sparkrender was severely weakened. The time had come to start the ritual, as a comet hung low in the sky. The blue dragon flew to the central sculpture of planets and stars and began chanting. The crude dragon statues surrounding began to glow and infuse him with powerful energy.

His wounds started to close up, as his body and muscles began to grow. Soon he would be unstoppable, the party feared. Loreanna had the idea to start firing arrows at the dragon statues, which successfully cut off energy to Sparkrender. Each statue toppled diminished his power. With the ritual interrupted, the party teamed up to finally slew the evil blue dragon. While searching the dragon's treasure pile, [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] was delighted to find a scroll to cast [[3-Mechanics/Items/Ritual of Create New Creature\|Ritual of Create New Creature]], just what he needed to make his dreams of a dragon-corgi hybrid come true!

The kobolds entered the rotunda and seemed confused and adrift. Not knowing where they would go now, the group invited them to return back to Dragon's Rest. There Myla was overjoyed to be reunited with her brothers, after a little chastising for leaving her in the first place. Runara was sad to hear that Sparkrender needed to be killed, but she was happy the party stopped the evil ritual from taking place.

To show her gratitude, she gave each player a potion of healing and a large valuable pearl and told them they would always be welcome at Dragon's Rest. The kobolds were so smitten with Aeverius "Kobold-Friend", they convinced him to stay and serve Bahamut on the island!
