# Mystery of The Seagrow Caves


Kanjigar awoke to his companions telling him the darkness is coming, and black darkness poured out their mouths, paralyzing him. As he was about to drown in the darkness, he screamed and woke up, realizing it was only a nightmare.

As they left their room, they heard people arguing near the entrance to [[2-World/Faer没n/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]]. It appeared [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tarak\|Tarak]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Graska and Harlan\|two strangers]] were about to come to blows, so [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] used the Command spell to cause one of them to flee, and the other did the same  voluntarily. Tarak was evasive about what the rough strangers wanted from him.


![Myla.webp|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Myla.webp)Suddenly, an explosion went off nearby. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Myla\|Myla]] the kobold tinkerer was furious at her assistant [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laylee\|Laylee]] for tampering with her magnet magma, creating the explosion and ruining Myla's experiments. Later, the party noticed Tarak was missing a boot. He told them about how he occasional goes to the [[2-World/Faer没n/Stormwreck Isle/Seagrow Caves\|Seagrow Caves]], populated by mushroom humanoids called Myconids in order to trade. He uses their mushrooms to create healing potions, but last time he visited he was attacked by a strange plant octopus and he lost his boot. The group agreed to help Tarak out and see what was going on in the caves.

![Laylee.png|right|300](/img/user/z_Assets/Laylee.png) [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] recommended the group take a guide, and Laylee was volunteered as a way to let the drama diffuse between her and Myla as well as let her get out for some adventure. On the walk, the party noticed some kobolds tracking them from a distance. Laylee recognized them as Myla's brothers, who left her for dead some years before. In order to avoid a conflict with them, [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] used an illusion to create an [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm\|Owlbear]] roar and scare them off.

![spore-servant-octopus.webp|left|500](/img/user/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/img/spore-servant-octopus.webp) At the caves, a giant plant-octopus creature blocked the entrance, holding Tarak's boot. The group dispatched the creature which fell apart to various plant and fungus material. As they explored the caves, they encountered child and adult Myconids, a race of mushroom-people who communicate telepathically using spores. They learned that the Myconid leader, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sinensa\|Sinensa]], and several others have fallen ill due to a sickness spreading through the caves.

![213-13-023-group-of-myconids.webp|right|500](/img/user/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/monster-manual-2025/img/213-13-023-group-of-myconids.webp) As the party continued to investigate, they found all manner of hostile creatures such as [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/stirge-xmm\|Stirges]], [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fume-drake-dosi\|Fume Drakes]], and a Fire Snake. Orange crystals blocked the ceiling hole, filling the cave with a noxious smoke coming from below the cave (believed to be the ancient red dragon Sharruth's breath). When they destroyed the crystals, a fire snake attacked from the shards. During the fight, Laylee was poisoned knocked unconscious, and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius]] stepped into to revive her.

![Defender Paladin.webp|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Defender%20Paladin.webp)This earned him much affinity, with Laylee bestowing on him the nickname "Kobold-Friend". She gathered magnet metal from the cave which [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Myla\|Myla]] used to create the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Defender Shield\|Defender Shield]] for Aevarius as a thanks for saving Laylee. Tarak also used mushrooms the party gathered to make healing potions.

On the walk back, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Graska and Harlan\|Graska and Harlan]] stopped the group and explained that they were there to find the treasure that [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tarak\|Tarak]] stole. They offered to split it with the party if the group helps them find it. The group said they would consider the offer.
