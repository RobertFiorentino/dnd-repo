# Welcome To Stormwreck Isle

![000-map-0-01-stormwreck-isle.webp|center|600](/img/user/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/000-map-0-01-stormwreck-isle.webp)

A group of adventurers sail to the remote Stormwreck Isle. Not knowing each other beforehand, each adventurer has their own reasons for coming to the island.

![2 - beach.webp|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/2%20-%20beach.webp)The strangers immediately faced danger as three zombies in ragged sailor clothing emerged from the water and attacked! After trying backflips, the new friends were able to take out the zombies and make their way up the stony path to [[2-World/Faerûn/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]].

![DragonsRestStairs.webp|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/DragonsRestStairs.webp)Once there, they were bombarded by many curious kobolds asking annoying questions. The leader, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] introduced the mountaintop retreat as a cloister dedicated to the dragon god Bahamut. They also met her human assistants, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tarak\|Tarak]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Varnoth\|Varnoth]]. The adventurers spent time getting to know the retreat and its inhabitants.
