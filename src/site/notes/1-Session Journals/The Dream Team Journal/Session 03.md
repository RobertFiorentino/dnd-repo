# Curse of the Compass Rose


As [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] pestered [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Myla\|Myla]] for more magic items, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Varnoth\|Varnoth]] came back with one of the kobolds, bloody form a fight with more [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm\|Zombies]]. They seemed to be coming from the north shore of the island, where many ships lately have been seeming to crash lately.

![RavenFamiliar.png|left|300](/img/user/z_Assets/RavenFamiliar.png)The party agreed to investigate the main ship, an old merchant vessel called [[2-World/Faerûn/Stormwreck Isle/Compass Rose\|Compass Rose]]. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] used his new [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb\|familiar]], a raven, to scout the wreckage. A winged creature was seen flying away, and the party suspected a dragon. This led to being nervous about spending too long investigating the ship.

The ship was broken in may places and rotting away. The wheel of the ship came off and they just barely caught it, saving it from crashing through the rotted wood below. Using the raven, they were able to find gems and gold in the crow's nest, which literally had a large nest in it.

![011-03-001-splash-art.webp|right|500](/img/user/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/011-03-001-splash-art.webp) As they explored the various cabins, they were greeted by a trio of zombies in what appeared to be the captain's quarters. A huge hole was in the corner, and several floors below could be seen a treasure chest that over time burst through the rotting wood. On the first floor was also found a painting of a man and a woman.

Below deck, more zombies awaited in knee-high water that made movement difficult. As the group focused on them, a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul-xmm\|Ghoul]] snuck up behind [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Loreanna Ashara\|Loreanna]] and began dragging her away, attempting to paralyze her. The party just let her alone to handle the ghoul.

The deck below was completely submerged. Loreanna volunteered to swim down and investigate the treasure chest, while the rest of the party showed their typical cowardice. Inside was a strange locket that emanated evil magic, some gems, and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Boots of Elvenkind\|Boots of Elvenkind]]. A journal was included, detailing the captain's witnessing of events. A woman onboard was desperate to reunite with her merchant husband (both from the painting), and as she was dying from the shipwreck used dark magic from the locket to ensure they could be together forever. This inadvertently turned her undead, and created the curse that has been raising the dead for the past 40 years.


![HarpyCloseup.png|left|300](/img/user/z_Assets/HarpyCloseup.png)
Just then, Isarin's raven started squawking uncontrollably. The monster flying earlier was coming back! The party rushed to the top deck to find a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy-xmm\|Harpy]] at the crow's nest, and she brought a harpy friend along with her. Her magical singing started luring the group to climb up the crow's nest and possibly fall to their deaths, but most resisted. After damaging the first harpy through ranged attacks, she flew away leaving only the second one. This harpy successfully enchanted [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius]], who pushed each other out of their way to try to get closer to what they perceived as the most beautiful woman in the world. More attacks from Loreanna and Isarin finally damaged the harpy enough to send her off for good.

When the party returned to [[2-World/Faerûn/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]], Runara confirmed that she knew the merchant from that ship and he died many years ago and was buried at a nearby cemetery. This raised questions about Runara's apparent age, but the party focused on breaking the curse. They traveled to the cemetery and buried the locket in the merchant's grave, which caused a thick fog to envelop them and what sounded like a sigh of relief. When the fog cleared, to the north they saw that the [[2-World/Faerûn/Stormwreck Isle/Compass Rose\|Compass Rose]] was gone.

With the curse broken, [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] had a dream that night of sunshine cutting through the darkness surrounding the island, completely purifying the land as he felt the love and approval of his god.

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Runara\|Runara]] had one last surprise for the party as they approached. “I have something to show you,” she said. There’s a flash like a silent stroke of lightning, and the human woman was gone. In her place was an enormous dragon with bronze-colored scales!

“Now you see me as I truly am,” she says, tilting her head with an expression that might be a smile on her scaled face. “As you have discovered, this island has many old wounds. And I’m afraid the cycle of violence is starting again. I have one more favor to ask you.”
