# Into The Woods
![Mylo.jpeg|left|200](/img/user/z_Assets/Mylo.jpeg) Several tendays have passed since [[1-Party/The Dream Team/The Dream Team\|The Dream Team]] stopped the [[1-Session Journals/The Dream Team Journal/Session 04\|evil ritual]] at the [[2-World/Clifftop Observatory\|Clifftop Observatory]], and our adventurers have taken a breather to relax and recuperate. This vacation was cut short by a trio looking for help for their home town. A rogue named [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Mylo\|Mylo]], a wizard [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Dandydalf\|Dandydalf]], and a bard called [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Onion\|Onion]] sailed to [[2-World/Faerûn/Stormwreck Isle/Dragon's Rest\|Dragon's Rest]] to seek out the adventurers who are already starting to make a name for themselves. When they approached, they were surprised by the wave of kobolds who descended on them, confused as to whether they were friend or foe. It turns out they were just curious and grabbed at Dandydalf's hat and Onion's lute, passing them around.

When the party came out to calm things down, [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Dandydalf\|Dandydalf]] explained that there are rumors of a goblin army organizing in the Neverwinter Wood outside of the town of [[2-World/Helms Hold\|Helms Hold]]. They've been tasked with finding an experienced party to investigate these rumors. The group agreed to join, all except [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Aevarius Starblade\|Aevarius]] who had become dear to the kobolds of Dragon's Rest. He stayed to further serve the dragon god Bahamut and protect the cloister.

![IsarinVGoliath.png|right|500](/img/user/z_Assets/IsarinVGoliath.png)While sailing to [[2-World/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]], Onion revealed that he was working on a song about a monk who was cursed to become a half dog. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] realized this was an opportunity to fulfill his deepest desire to [[3-Mechanics/Items/Ritual of Create New Creature\|create a dragon-corgi]] hybrid. There was drama on the docks though, when Mylo introduced his thieves guild contact [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Goliath\|Goliath]], who [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] recognized as his half-brother Elaris! Isarin told the group how Goliath ran away from the family and became a thief, stealing a valuable gem and disgracing the Duskweaver family. Isarin has been trying to bring prestige back to the family ever since, and is furious at the idea of having to work with his brother. As wand was raised to cast a damaging spell, and dagger was raised to meet it, dockside guards intervened and prevented the fight from starting.

![Kanjigar chasing chickens.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Kanjigar%20chasing%20chickens.png) The group left Neverwinter and headed down the High Road to the walled city of [[2-World/Helms Hold\|Helms Hold]]. While walking through the marketplace, [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] was overtaken by a desire to steal a chicken. Despite a round woman running out and beating him with a rolling pin, Kanjigar couldn't resist trying to nab a chicken again. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Mylo\|Mylo]] soon joined in the frenzy. Eventually the group decided to split up, with [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Dandydalf\|Dandydalf]], [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]], [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Goliath\|Goliath]], and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Mylo\|Mylo]] heading to the chapel and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]], [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Loreanna Ashara\|Loreanna]], and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Onion\|Onion]] going to a local tavern to investigate rumors of a dog-man.

In the chapel they met the Chief Speaker [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gunther Wuldrogen\|Gunther Wuldrogen]], as well as council members [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Thordram Steelmantle\|Thordram Steelmantle]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Larassandra De'vin\|Larassandra De'vin]]. Gunther organized the investigation into the goblin presence in Neverwinter Wood, while Thordram and Larassandra opposed the investigation, not believing the rumors. Gunther thought it prudent to at least look into the possibility, and offered the adventurers 50 gold apiece if they could find evidence of such an organized army forming.

[[1-Party/The Dream Team/Goliath\|Goliath]] led the group through the Neverwinter Wood, having previously met with the imposing hobgoblin [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Bethzarra\|Bethzarra]] "Black Betty" along with his thief mentor. Kanjigar used divine magic to yell really loudly for goblins, and when that didn't work suggested that they just burn down the entire forest. At times Goliath seemed lost, and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] was growing increasingly frustrated at being led around by his criminal half-brother. He used his raven familiar to begin scouting a path on his own, while other party members started making their own suggestions of different paths to take.

![Thertume bear pins Kanjigar.png|left|500](/img/user/z_Assets/Thertume%20bear%20pins%20Kanjigar.png)As the party squabbled about the best path forward, a giant brown bear sprung out of the trees and pounced on [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]], claws raised ready to take his head off! A tense standoff took place, which was broken by everyone's surprise when the bear started talking. He accused the group of being a part of the goblin army that has been destroying large swaths of the forest, uprooting trees to build siege weapons and burning other parts down.

![Thertume.png|right|250](/img/user/z_Assets/Thertume.png)The group convinced the bear that they were the good guys, and the bear shifted its shape to reveal that it was actually a dragonborn druid named [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Thertume Moonbeam\|Thertume Moonbeam]]. This was the same dragonborn that Runara had mentioned earlier. Kanjigar asked for his participation in the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Ritual of Create New Creature\|Ritual of Create New Creature]], and Thertume agreed in exchange for the group helping rid the forest of the goblin forces.

![BlackBettyPortrait.png|left|500](/img/user/z_Assets/BlackBettyPortrait.png)With Goliath and Thertume leading the way through the woods, the party approached a clearing surrounded by high hilltops. To their surprise, a host of goblins, bugbears, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Bethzarra\|Black Betty]] herself sprung out from hiding, completely surrounding the group. Betty gave orders to kill the party and make it look like an accident, while casually commenting that [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Larassandra De'vin\|Larassandra]]'s information was good and that they would keep her on the payroll. They were set up!

As Betty left, her squad attacked. Although surrounded, surprised,  half composed of fresh new adventurers and everyone at each others' throats, the team came together. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Goliath\|Goliath]] immediately opened up a nearby goblin's stomach with two whirling dagger attacks. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Kanjigar The Courageous\|Kanjigar]] disintegrated another goblin with holy flames. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Dandydalf\|Dandydalf]] and [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Isarin Duskweaver\|Isarin]] lit up the field with color sprays and shattering force. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Onion\|Onion]] [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/vicious-mockery-xphb\|viciously mocked]] the huge bugbears, that made clumsy attempts to grab and grapple [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Loreanna Ashara\|Loreanna]] who nimbly danced out of the way, firing arrows all the while. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Mylo\|Mylo]] scampered underfoot, nicking and slashing with daggers of his own. [[1-Party/The Dream Team/Thertume Moonbeam\|Thertume]] showed he didn't only have a bear up his sleeve, but transformed into a roaring [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/lion-xmm\|Lion]] and dashed straight up a mountainside to tear a goblin archer in half.

The fight ended with Goliath sending an arrow through the last [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/bugbear-warrior-xmm\|bugbear's]] back, causing him to cough up blood all over Dandydalf, Mylo, and Kanjigar. The last goblin archer realized the fight was over and dashed into the woods, eager to let Black Betty know about the turn of events. When they searched one of the fallen bugbears, they found an incriminating note from [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Larassandra De'vin\|Larassandra]]:
