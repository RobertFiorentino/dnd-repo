# The Old Circus and the Sea
After some back and forth, it was decided [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] would need to make haste to catch up with the circus that the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Plague Rats\|Plague Rats]] infiltrated. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]] remained with the group, intent on freeing his friends. Using the group funds, they paid 25 GP apiece to get to [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] in around five days.

![BoatSailing.png|left](/img/user/z_Assets/BoatSailing.png)On the voyage, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] asked [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] about his upbringing learning to fight with weapons. Cinder discussed that as a youth, he was more interested in chasing tavern girls and socializing with other nobles for the latest gossip. He mentioned that he had never learned to fight until recently, and that he was learning the ways of the blade very quickly. Cinder revealed that this exceptional learning and ability came at a price however, adding cryptically "perhaps a terrible price." Ragnar showed him how to use his two-handed [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/halberd-xphb\|Halberd]] which Cinder practiced the remainder of the trip, showing a moderate amount of progress.

Meanwhile, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] spent his voyage studying his newfound [[3-Mechanics/Items/Spyglass of the Planes\|spyglass]]. Puzzled as to how it worked, Renan kept his activities mostly secret but brought it to [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] who gave him some information and advice.

Upon reaching [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]], [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] were shocked to see that the city had been devastated by the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]] as much as [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]. The party surmised that the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Plague Rats\|Plague Rats]] were using the circus as an infection vector, using the traveling nature to spread the plague without arousing suspicion.

Also of note, the Lower City's traditional peace keepers, the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Flaming Fist\|Flaming Fist]] were nowhere to be found. They appear to have been replaced by the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] guard, which aroused the group's suspicion. The party also noticed many individuals wearing [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Gray Cloaks\|Gray Cloaks]] who were tending to the dead. These cloaks seemed familiar, though they couldn't exactly place where they had seen them.

The party headed to the [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Circus of Hostages\|circus]], and found two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm\|Ogres]] guarding the entrance. As they walked about, they saw it was sparsely attended and ran by mostly goblins and other typically evil humanoids. The elves and humanoids there seemed nervous and being held against their will. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] spoke to a wood elf woman in her native tongue, and verified that they were being held hostage to provide cover for their evil captors.

Two of the party tried their luck with a fortune teller, with one winning a healing potion, and another getting curse for his next fight. They considered outright attacking the captors, but of concern was several wild animals caged by the circus dwellers, including an [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm\|Owlbear]], lions, and a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-xmm\|Displacer Beast]].

![FireworksCircus.png|right|700](/img/user/z_Assets/FireworksCircus.png) The group noticed a well-stocked fireworks cart not far from the main circus tent. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] hatched a plan to create a diversion with the fireworks while [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] freed the hostages. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] used a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand-xphb\|mysterious hand]] to bring a torch onto the fireworks cart and all mayhem broke loose as the fireworks began setting the entire circus on fire. The party successfully freed most if not all of the hostages and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]] brought them to safety at a predetermined location halfway to [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]].

The party met at the rendezvous point and were surprised at how well the plan worked out, without even needing to fight. They were rewarded with their ingenuity with a level up to 3!
