# Battle of Three Butlers
As our heroes tried to make their escape, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gerad The Butler\|Gerad The Butler]] had other plans. He went off on a monologue about how the Von Cheddarsburghs were afflicted and that they were too dangerous to let out. The guards began attacking so the time for discussion was clearly over!

![Three Butlers.png|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Three%20Butlers.png)[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] started out the combat with a molotov cocktail that burned up two of the guards and the butler. There was some confusion, as there were two sets of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Marco & Victoria Von Cheddarsburgh\|Von Cheddarsburgh couples]], and things got even more mixed up when [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] came out of his romantic activities and immediately turned his appearance to match the butler! A nearby fake Marco engaged in melee with the wizard, only to turn into the butler as well! It was the butler's I am Spartacus moment for sure.

All this shape changing confused everyone, as one of the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger-xmm\|Doppelgangers]] shifted into [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]]. Friends and enemies attacked haphazardly, not entirely sure if they were hitting friend or foe. The Von Cheddarsburgh turned into their [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/werewolf-xmm\|Werewolf]] forms and fought alongside the companions for a while, but eventually fled to rescue their children from the basement. The butler also brought a new twist to the battle, as he used dark magic to [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm\|reanimate]] slain guards' corpses.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder]] showed off some new moves he was working on, swinging his [[3-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/improved-pact-weapon-xge\|shadowy glaive]] around to attack from all sorts of new angles, hitting enemies with the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/polearm-master-xphb\|butt-end and spearing them]] before they could get up close. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma]] pummeled a butler imposter, as the real butler let loose a violent [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ice-storm-xphb\|Ice Storm]] that did some serious damage to Jelma, Dr. Buckles and killing his  dopplebutler ally.

![Von Cheddarsburgh Werewolves.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Von%20Cheddarsburgh%20Werewolves.png)Just as the battle seemed to be in hand, the Von Cheddarsburghs returned with their [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul-xmm\|Ghoul]] children in tow, and they were all hungry! They took bites out of guard and ally alike, not caring who they were attacking. At this point the party started to wonder if maybe the butler was correct in caging them...

When the last of the monsters were felled, the group searched the estate for funds for their exile. They came up with 5,000 gold, [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dust-of-disappearance-xdmg\|Dust of Disappearance]], and [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mariners-armor-xdmg\|Mariner's Armor]] breastplate. More notes and journals came up confirming that the butler was placed there by Titus to gather their votes from the council. The party assumed this has happened in other noble houses as well, which would help explain Titus' rise to power.

As the group left the estate, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Alabaster Cunningham\|Alabaster]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Lara Romanov\|Lara]] rode up on a small wagon pulled by a donkey, disguised as simple people. They updated the group that strange trade caravans were headed out of Waterdeep, mostly heading northeast towards the Spine of the World, the Nations of Many Arrows and wood elves' territories.
