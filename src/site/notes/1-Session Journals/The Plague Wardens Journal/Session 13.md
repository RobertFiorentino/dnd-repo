# A Trail of Ghosts, A New Chapter Begins
> [!readaloud] Intro
> Three of your companions - [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma]], [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]], and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]] - swing lifeless from the gallows in [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]], their faces pale against the blackened sky. The memory burns like acid: the jeering crowd, the stench of sickness in the air, the iron taste of helplessness as you fled. Outlaws now, hunted by the city you once called ally, you carry their silence with you like a curse. 
> 
> The plague spreads faster than whispers. Villages you pass are hushed tombs—doors barred, windows shuttered, smoke curling from pyres where the dead are burned to keep the sickness from crawling further. The air is thick with rot and fear. Every cough feels like a death knell. Every shadow hides a spy.

![Wealdath-Map.png|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Wealdath-Map.png)Weary from too much time on the road and downtrodden from the loss of their friends and allies, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] finally made their way to the Wood Elf city [[2-World/Suldanessellar\|Suldanessellar]] in the [[2-World/Wealdath Forest\|Wealdath Forest]]. Most of the group was looking forward to a warm welcome, a hot meal, and some rest. Such was not to be, and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] knew better as he had to confront his past.

![Suldanessellar.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Suldanessellar.png)At the gates of [[2-World/Suldanessellar\|Suldanessellar]], the worn-down trio were confronted by a gate [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Captain Thalindra Moonspear\|Captain Thalindra Moonspear]]. The group were immediately recognized as outlaws and were not welcome. Much to their shock, it was revealed that [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] was actually exiled and never meant to return to this city, being branded a traitor. Renan's old friend [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sylthas Virel\|Sylthas Virel]] appeared and mocked Renan for his cowardice in the Underdark against the Drow. He mentioned [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Kaelen Duskwhisper\|Kaelen Duskwhisper]], another friend who was captured and presumed enslaved or killed in the Underdark. Renan explained that they were ambushed and he couldn't help Kaelen without getting caught himself.

After some banter back and forth, it was agreed that the plague wardens could meet with the [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Elder Faelar Silverbranch\|Elder Faelar Silverbranch]] and the Council. As they discussed their issue with the Drow constantly raiding, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder]] lost his patience and pointed out that none of this matters if the entire continent is wiped out by plague or overridden by his tyrannical brother [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus]]. The council debated whether to shut the party out of their gates or offer help.  A peculiar man in a plague doctor mask named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Draven Veyl\|Draven Veyl]], seemingly allied to the cult of [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]], chimed in and voiced support for [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]], warning that the forest will burn without their help.

Suddenly, horns blared and it was declared the Drow were attacking! The council made a hasty offer to the group: prove your worth in battle and then we can see about working together. Sent with them to oversee was a rock gnome cleric named [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Brerik\|Brerik]] who was quick to crack a joke. Also joining was [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Corin SwiftShadow\|Corin SwiftShadow]], a halfling bard. As they raced to defend the Ward Stones that protect the city, Corin spoke about trying to find out about his lost brother. It was revealed that his brother was none other than the famous bard [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Laverneous\|Laverneous]], who was captured and killed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus]]. Before they could tell the entire tale, torches flared near the Ward Stones and the group realized they were surrounded by enemies.

![brerik-charms-drow-mage 1.png|left|200](/img/user/z_Assets/brerik-charms-drow-mage%201.png)A seemingly endless supply of drow warriors, spiders, and a mage came at the group from all angles. Early in the battle, the mage unleashed a deadly [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cloudkill-xphb\|Cloudkill]] spell, sucking the breath and life  from some of the group. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Brerik\|Brerik]], seemingly able to make anyone laugh, was able to [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person-xphb\|charm]] the mage and distracted him enough to lay off the devastating wizardry for a little while. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] stalked among the treetops, sniping at his hated Drow enemies.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Corin SwiftShadow\|Corin]] sang songs of battle that [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce-xphb\|shrunk]] an elite warrior down to fun-size, but the warrior still packed a huge punch with his multiple deadly attacks. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder]] had a tough day of battle, trying to forgo his darker powers but coming close to death due to the cloudkill and barrage from the elite warrior. The new additions of [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Brerik\|Brerik]] and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Corin SwiftShadow\|Corin]] were both able to bring the party back up to full strength, and boy did this group miss having healers!

![ragnar-tiny-drow-elite 1.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/ragnar-tiny-drow-elite%201.png)While the regular Drow warriors could not get through [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]]'s plate, the elite still was running rampant. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] got fed up and threw the tiny menace into the cloudkill, while also unleashing a mighty smite and finishing off the once-friendly mage as well. The remaining spiders fled with their masters slain. As the party examined the Ward Stones, something strange happened...
