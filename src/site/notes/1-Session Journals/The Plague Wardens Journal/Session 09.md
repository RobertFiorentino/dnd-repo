# The Battle of Disadvantages
![CircusChickens.png|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/CircusChickens.png)The battle continued at the [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Circus of Hostages\|Circus of Hostages]]. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma Shiningeyes]] subdued the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wererat-xmm\|Wererat]], with Jelma stuffing him in the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-xmm\|Displacer Beast]] cage. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]] bolted out of the tent towards the ogres, not paying attention as [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] took some serious slashes from the displacer beast before crawling out of the tent and under the safety of his giant lion friend.

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] snuck attacked the displacer beast, who promptly wrapped him in tentacles for the remainder of the combat. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma Shiningeyes]], [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]], and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] triple teamed the beast who would not seem to go down. Cinder distracted the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm\|Ogres]] with his [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness-xphb\|Darkness]] with [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma Shiningeyes]] finishing the last one off. Dozens of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chicken-xdmg\|Chickens]] appeared on the field of battle, leading to strange new possibilities as to the source of the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]].

In the [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/MurkTail\|wererat]]'s pocket were travel plans to the Amn region. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] prepare to bring this information to the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]].
