# The Secret of the Ooze
![Green Slop.png|left|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Green%20Slop.png)The party made their way to the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Von Cheddarsburgh Estate\|Von Cheddarsburgh Estate]] in their disguises. As dinner commences, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Marco & Victoria Von Cheddarsburgh\|Marco & Victoria Von Cheddarsburgh]] make the rounds with small talk among the nobles. The group found out the supporting families for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus Belabranta]]: House Wands, Roaringhorn, the military family Hawkwinter, and the Von Cheddarsbughs. As [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] worked his way into the kitchen, he got on the chef's good side by complaining about Victoria. The chef revealed that Victoria started changing once the new [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gerad The Butler\|butler]] came around about a month prior. Our other heroes meanwhile ate a green oozy delicacy, and tried to engage Victoria in conversation but she seemed completely out of sorts and dense.

![Guard War Gong.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Guard%20War%20Gong.png)Seeking more evidence, Renan needed a distraction to break into the butler's quarters. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma]] started playing the war gong to great approval, and a guard came up showing interest. Jelma showed him how to play, and the guard turned out to be a natural, wowing the nobles in attendance which succeeded in drawing attention away from the antics upstairs.

![Hunchback Massage.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/Hunchback%20Massage.png)The group reconvened upstairs, where a hunchback swept the floor. Jelma eased the hunchback's burdens by giving him a deep, invigorating, tender, dare I say sensual massage. Renan found the butler's journal, which revealed the Von Cheddarsburghs already suffered an affliction and that he would need to start taking measures to rise to power.

Through their investigations, they found out that the old butler Jeeves died quickly a short time before the new butler Gerad showed up. The butler was sent by none other than [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus]]. The party also noticed while looking at a painting of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Marco & Victoria Von Cheddarsburgh\|Marco & Victoria Von Cheddarsburgh]] that they looked different from the people downstairs claiming to be them...

The last place to visit was the basement hatch in the kitchen. There they found the real Marco and Victoria, who seemed afflicted with lycanthropy, along with their four children who had been turned to ghouls. It turns out the Von Cheddarsburgh opposed Titus, which led to them being imprisoned. In the next room they found a prayer room to [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]], along with [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack-xdmg\|Heward's Handy Haversack]], [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-ammunition-xdmg\|+2 Ammunition]], a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-frost-giant-strength-xdmg\|Potion of Frost Giant Strength]], and a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-stone-giant-strength-xdmg\|Potion of Stone Giant Strength]].

Conflicted on how to proceed, the group freed the Von Cheddarsburghs but not the ghouls and used magical [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness-xphb\|Darkness]] to try to sneak the nobles out of the house. Before they could escape however, the butler barred the doors shut as the guards circled.
