# The Devil You Know
On the boat ride back to [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]], the party interrogated the captured wererat whom they learned was named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/MurkTail\|MurkTail]]. He mostly just followed orders and didn't know much, but did reveal the names of the head priest Vermund and his paladin bodyguard Cheddarclaw. They worship the goddess of disease, [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]]. They have a shrine, though we're not sure if it's the same location the party was imprisoned at under the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Rat Hills\|Rat Hills]].

[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] brought up [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]]'s troubling behavior as of late, and Cinder felt the need to explain what happened to him. He recounted his past as a nobleman, his kind father, older brother Walter, and younger brother [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus Belabranta]]. Cinder's brother and father died in quick succession and under mysterious circumstances. Cinder found himself ill-equipped to run the Belabranta estate, but did not have long before Titus challenged him to a duel for the right to rule the house under an obscure ancient law.

![Pasted image 20250313103451.png|left|300](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250313103451.png) Cinder was never a martial sort, in stark contrast to the combative and ambitious Titus. The younger brother always had resentment toward his father for "polluting the Belabranta line" with non-human blood, and this enmity passed on to Cinder. Titus easily won the duel, leaving Cinder with a fatal wound and having his lackeys dump him in an alley.

With Cinder's last grasps of consciousness, he felt the blade at his side speak to him and give him power. This [[3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock-xphb-the-hexblade-xge\|otherworldly entity]] would infuse Cinder with its magic, in exchange for the death and violence he would impart on his quest to reclaim his title. Cinder dispatched the dumbstruck lackey and absorbed his life force, healing his wounds.

Since then, Cinder has devoted his focus to perfecting his skills at dueling in order to be ready to take back his title when the time was right. He has also been trying to find out information on his brother's activities, even suspecting that Titus may be one of the masked [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Lords of Waterdeep\|Lords of Waterdeep]].

![MurkTailGoats.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/MurkTailGoats.png) The party wheeled their prisoner off the docks, only to get strange looks. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] used his magic to make the caged wererat appear as goats, of the screaming variety in case he made noise. With this foolproof plan, the group decided to stray from convening with the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|council]] and instead made their way to the center of the city for a mandatory town hall style meeting.

Here [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Warwick Mahningham\|Warwick Mahningham]] would lead the announcement. He recounted the news of [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] being struck by the plague, and how the nobility had been decimated as well. This led to the disbanding of the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Lords of Waterdeep\|Lords of Waterdeep]], and the council (supposedly) appointed the new Open Lord to be the first king of [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]].

![TitusBelabrantaPortrait.png|left|300](/img/user/z_Assets/TitusBelabrantaPortrait.png) This new king was none other than Cinder's brother, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Titus Belabranta\|Titus Belabranta]]! Titus was given credit for curing the disease, but even worse, he falsely named all the members of the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]] and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] as the originators and spreaders of the plague. Wanted posters were put up around the city for each of the members. Priests of [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]] (the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Gray Cloaks\|Gray Cloaks]] the party had noticed) replaced priests of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/deities/forgotten-realms-ilmater\|Ilmater]] as the main force of spiritual wisdom in the city. 

But Titus' ambitions do not stop there. He announced that Waterdeep would be taking over the ruling of [[2-World/Faerûn/Baldurs Gate/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] due to its level of destruction from the plague. As the group wheeled away their screaming goats, a hooded figure pulled [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma Shiningeyes]] down an alley and the group followed. It turned out to be [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Lara Romanov\|Lara Romanov]], who led them to a closed tavern with the remaining council members.

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Alabaster Cunningham\|Alabaster]] had proudly grown a beard to hide his identity and recommended [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] do the same. He discussed the events leading to the coronation but admitted not having many resources to help the adventurers out on their quest. When presented with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/MurkTail\|MurkTail]] the prisoner, Alabaster dispatched the wererat without hesitation.

The council did have the means to magically disguise the party and help them infiltrate a noble dinner at the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Von Cheddarsburgh Estate\|Von Cheddarsburgh Estate]] to gather information and potential allies. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]] is pretending to be Nero Roaringhorn, a house famous for arts and arcane studies. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma Shiningeyes\|Jelma Shiningeyes]] his musician, specializing in playing the war gong and [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] playing the part of a cleric of [[2-World/Faerûn/Talona\|Talona]]. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] represented the magical house Wands, with [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] as his servant Gouda.
