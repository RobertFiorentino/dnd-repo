The [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Waterdeep Plague\|Waterdeep Plague]] has ravaged the city of [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]. The party was assembled by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Council on the Plague\|Council on the Plague]]. For whatever reason, the members of party have proven immune to the plague.

The group was tasked with uncovering the source of the plague, for a payment of 25 GP per month. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cynthoria\|Cynthoria]] was charged with holding onto additional funds that the group may need in their investigation. We were informed that other similar groups would also be investigating the plague.



Our only lead was a [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Boarded up inn\|Boarded up inn]] that seemed to be where the earliest victims of the plague came from.  The party found mysterious [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]] in buckets throughout the inn. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]] spilled some on his newly purchased [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/fine-clothes-xphb\|Fine Clothes]], much to his pretentious dismay.

Out the back door lead to a well that went down to the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Sewers\|sewers]], but the character who started down the rope decided to climb back up and find another way in.

The party found another entrance into the sewers and were confronted by goblins dressed in bright yellow clothing claiming they worked for the city. A fight ensued, with the goblins being killed except one who was exceptional at hiding. During and after the fight, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder Belabranta\|Cinder Belabranta]] was observed yelling at his sword when some of his swings did not connect.
