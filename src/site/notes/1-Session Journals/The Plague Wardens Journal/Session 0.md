# Session 0 Overview



Everyone rolled their characters using the 4d6, drop the lowest, but got to roll two sets of stats and keep whichever they wanted.

We also fleshed out our character sheets, including traits and flaws.

Dave informed us that we would be in the [[2-World/Faerûn/Faerûn\|Forgotten Realms]] setting.
