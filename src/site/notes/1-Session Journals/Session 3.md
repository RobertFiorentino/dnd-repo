# The Muenster Mash



[[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/The Plague Wardens\|The Plague Wardens]] continued searching the sewers and found one passageway blocked by rubble. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] used [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast-xphb\|Eldritch Blast]] to force the rubble out of the way. While searching the rubble, several silver weapons were found which would be useful later.

![BaronCheddar.png|right|400](/img/user/z_Assets/BaronCheddar.png)On the other side of the rubble was [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Baron von Cheddarsburgh\|Baron von Cheddarsburgh]], a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight-xmm\|Wight]] several hundred years old. The Baron was very crude, insulting our female ancestors and implying he had intimate relations with many of them. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] tried to reason with him, noble to noble, rolling a 27 but his hatred was too deep. The Baron had a painting on hand that he cherished, and "was able to prove the painting was fake and kept it as trophy as triumph over fake news". On the Baron's death, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] seemed to suck his essence into his own body through his sword. Several cheese wheels of various sizes were available for the taking after dispatching the undead nobleman.

The party moved upwards to find an alternate route out and stumbled into a nest of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler-xmm\|4 foot long multi-legged worms]]. The party needed a rest and decided to rest here, advancing to Level 2!
