# Here a Rat, Were a Rat


![DrownedGoblin.png|right|500](/img/user/z_Assets/DrownedGoblin.png)The party moved forward, encountering a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/goblin-minion-xmm\|goblin]] with a very dumb [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm\|Ogre]] wearing brightly colored performers clothes and claiming once again to work for the city.  This time, the group merely followed them as they brought a big vat of the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]] to the marshes where it appeared they were getting ready to load it onto a ship.  After debating how to handle the issue, the goblin and ogre returned and set upon the party.  The party defeated them, but not before [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma\|Jelma]] took a strong thrashing from the ogre, but not before he performed his signature Crouching-Monk-Drowning-Goblin maneuver. 

Returning into the sewers, the party entered the well room that [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] had [[1-Session Journals/Session 1\|initially descended into]].  They encountered a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wererat-xmm\|Wererat]], surrounded by several well-groomed giant rats we assumed to be his pets.  [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma\|Jelma]] immediately ate got swept into a river again, perhaps as penance for drowning a goblin earlier. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] rained fire down upon the rats.  [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] used magical energy to rip pieces from the were rat.  At the climax of the fight, the wererat bit down upon [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]], and if it were not for a high constitution roll, the party could’ve been very different.  Shaking it off, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] used thunderous smite to launch the wererat into a wall, killing him instantly and transforming him back into the mustached man we’d initially encountered in the alchemy lab.

As the party caught its breath, they spotted a pile of halfling performers, some clothed in brightly colored garb and others naked.  They deduced the goblins had ambushed a troupe and stolen their clothing to blend in.  [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Dr. Buckles\|Dr. Buckles]] sadly began gathering the dead for a proper burial. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Renan\|Renan]] noticed that the mysterious mustached man had thieves cant on one arm.  [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] noticed religious symbolism on the other arm but was unable to pinpoint the exact origin.  [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Cinder\|Cinder]] decided to take action, cutting the symbol from the arm to present to the authorities. With new leads the investigate, the party decided to return to the city for retail therapy and to report their findings on the [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]] to their patrons.

Further investigation of the sewers led the party outside into a swamp. There they fought and killed that were also dressed yellow circus clothes. They were bringing out wheelbarrows full of [[2-World/Faerûn/Waterdeep/Waterdeep Plague/Black Goo\|Black Goo]], seemingly to be picked up by ship.

The group went back into the sewers to investigate another tunnel from earlier. They recognized this large room as the well room they had seen [[1-Session Journals/Session 1\|earlier in their adventure]]. Also present was the mustashioed  [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wererat-xmm\|Wererat]] that disappeared earlier, along with giant rats to back him up. This time we were able to damage him with the silver weapons we found earlier before confronting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Baron von Cheddarsburgh\|Baron von Cheddarsburgh]]. During the fight, [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Jelma\|Jelma]] had a lot of trouble in the water and almost drowned himself, possibly due to karma for drowning a goblin earlier. [[1-Party/The Plague Wardens/Ragnar\|Ragnar]] obliterated the wererat with a ferocious [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divine-smite-xphb\|Divine Smite]].
